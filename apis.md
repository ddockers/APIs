# APIs

API stands for Application Programming Interface. They transfer data between two systems.

The API can be seen as a mediator between two platforms, usually between a client and a server.

The below diagram shows the data transfer process in

## HTTP Methods
HTTP methods are the methods the client uses to contact the API. They follow the same steps as *CRUD - create, read, update, delete*.

In this case, the methods are **Post, Get, Put, Delete**.

First, you need the verb. e.g., *post*, *get*, etc.

Then, we need the URL. Where are we making this request?

The version is the http version used to send the request.

Headers are the key:value pairs.

Body is optional if using get.
